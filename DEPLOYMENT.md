# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Your ABC Giganten project is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment! ðŸš€

## What was configured:

1. **Vite Configuration** (`vite.config.ts`):
   - Added `base: '/abc-giganten/'` for GitHub Pages repository path
   - Output directory set to `dist`

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - Automatic deployment on push to main branch
   - Builds the project and deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Uses Node.js 18 and caches dependencies for faster builds

3. **Jekyll Bypass** (`public/.nojekyll`):
   - Prevents GitHub Pages from processing files through Jekyll
   - Ensures Vite assets are served correctly

## Steps to complete the deployment:

### 1. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/jaeniboy/abc-giganten
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The workflow will automatically trigger on the next push

### 3. Access your deployed site:
After the workflow completes, your site will be available at:
**https://jaeniboy.github.io/abc-giganten/**

## Automatic Deployment:
- Every push to the `main` branch will automatically rebuild and deploy
- You can monitor deployment progress in the **Actions** tab
- Build typically takes 2-3 minutes

## Manual Deployment:
You can also trigger deployment manually:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** button

## Local Development:
The base path is only applied in production builds. For local development:
```bash
npm run dev  # Still works at http://localhost:3001/
```

## Troubleshooting:
- If images don't load, check that SVG files are in `public/images/`
- If the site shows a 404, verify the repository name matches the base path
- Check the Actions tab for build errors

Your ABC Giganten game is ready for the world! ðŸŽ®ðŸ“š
