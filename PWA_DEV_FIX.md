n# PWA Development Fix ðŸ”§

## Issue Resolved
The development server was showing PWA warnings and not loading correctly due to the service worker trying to cache files that don't exist in development mode.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Disabled PWA in Development**
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
devOptions: {
  enabled: false // Disabled in dev to avoid issues
}
```

### 2. **Conditional PWA Component**
```typescript
// ReloadPrompt.tsx - Only renders in production
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  return null;
}
```

### 3. **Clean Development Experience**
- âœ… `npm run dev` now starts without PWA warnings
- âœ… App loads normally in development
- âœ… PWA features still work perfectly in production
- âœ… No caching issues during development

## Development vs Production

| Environment | PWA Status | Service Worker | Caching |
|-------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| Development | Disabled   | No             | No      |
| Production  | Enabled    | Yes            | Yes     |

## Testing Workflow

1. **Development**: `npm run dev` (normal browser behavior)
2. **PWA Testing**: `npm run build && npm run preview` (full PWA features)
3. **Deployment**: Push to GitHub Pages (automatic PWA deployment)

This approach provides the best developer experience while maintaining full PWA functionality in production! ðŸš€
